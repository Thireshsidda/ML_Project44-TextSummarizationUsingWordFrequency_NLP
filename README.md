# ML_Project44-TextSummarizationUsingWordFrequency_NLP

### Text Summarization using Word Frequency
This project implements a text summarization technique based on word frequency analysis.

### Key Functionalities:
Identifies the most important sentences in a given text document.

Generates a concise summary that captures the main points of the document.

Employs word frequency as a measure of sentence importance.


### Steps Performed:

##### Text Preprocessing:
Load the text document.

Tokenize the text into sentences and words.

Remove stop words (common words with little semantic meaning).

Word Frequency Analysis:

Calculate the frequency of each word in the document.


### Sentence Scoring:
Assign a score to each sentence based on the sum of the frequencies of its constituent words.

### Summary Generation:
Select the top n sentences with the highest scores to form the summary.

### Note:
This is a basic implementation of text summarization using word frequency.

More advanced summarization techniques incorporate additional factors like sentence position and sentence similarity.


### Further Exploration:

This project can be extended to:
Implement different summarization algorithms (e.g., LexRank, TF-IDF).
Evaluate the performance of the summarization using metrics like ROUGE score.
Integrate the summarization functionality into a larger application.
